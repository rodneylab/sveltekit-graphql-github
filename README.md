SvelteKit demo code for using Apollo Client to query a GraphQL API. The demo queries the GitHub GraphQL API to pull metadata on your public repos.

See the [Use Apollo Client with SvelteKit](https://rodneylab.com/use-apollo-client-sveltekit/) for more on how to set this site up. The demo site is live on Render at [sveltekit-graphql-github.rodneylab.com](https://sveltekit-graphql-github.rodneylab.com/)

Please drop questions into a comment at the bottom of the post page.

## Building and previewing the site

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-graphql-github.git
cd sveltekit-graphql-github
pnpm install # or npm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
